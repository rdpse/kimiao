Requirements
==============
You'll need an existing KS or SyS account and a PayPal account embedded to it.
If you don't have one, choose a random available server - this is a lot easier if done through the /fr website - and fill in all the necessary data.
Choose PayPal as your payment method; you will be redirected to PayPal to confirm an authorization towards OVH. Then you'll be redirected to OVH again so you can confirm your order, which you (presumably) won't.
Make sure your account was successfully created by logging in to the corresponding manager (KS or SyS*).

*Support for SyS servers will be added soon.

Usage
===========
Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdpse/kimiao/master/run.sh && bash run.sh`

Tested on Debian 8 x64 and CentOS 7 x64.
